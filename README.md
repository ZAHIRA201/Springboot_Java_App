## **Introduction**

This Spring Boot application empowers you to streamline educational staff management and organize exams with ease. It leverages the power of a dynamic web framework, making it a breeze to navigate and manage your educational ecosystem.

## **Tech Stack**

- **Spring MVC:** Provides a structured foundation for building your web application using the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture, ensuring a clear separation of concerns. [Learn more](https://spring.io/guides/gs/serving-web-content)
- **Spring Data JPA:** Simplifies database interactions through magical object-relational mapping (ORM), allowing you to interact with your database using Java objects like a pro. [Learn more](https://spring.io/projects/spring-data-jpa)
- **Spring Security:** Acts as your digital bodyguard, implementing robust authentication (login) and authorization (access control) mechanisms to keep your data secure. [Learn more](https://spring.io/projects/spring-security)
- **JSP:** The dynamic duo with Spring MVC, JSP generates dynamic content within the View layer, ensuring your web pages are visually engaging and interactive.

## **Getting Started (Launch Sequence)**

### **Prerequisites**

Ensure you have the following tools installed on your system:

- **Java Development Kit (JDK):** Make sure you have JDK 11 or later. [Download here](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/jdk17-archive-downloads.html)
- **Maven 3 or later:** This build tool will assemble your project efficiently. [Download here](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi)
- **Database:** Choose your champion: MySQL, PostgreSQL, or even H2 (for in-memory testing).

### **Database Setup**

1. Edit `src/main/resources/application.properties` to configure your chosen database connection details.
2. Ensure your database schema is created. Refer to your database documentation for creation scripts or tools.

## Lift Off! (Accessing the Application)

Your application should typically be accessible at [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) in your web browser. Buckle up!

## Features (Your Arsenal)

### Staff Management:

- Effortlessly manage your educational staff (teachers, administrators, etc.)‚Äîadd, edit, and delete them with a few clicks.
- View a comprehensive list of staff members with details like name, ID, department, and more. Implement filtering and sorting for a truly customized experience!

### Exam Management:

- Create exams with ease, specifying subject, date, time, duration, and all the essential details.
- Assign classes and staff members to conduct exams, ensuring a smooth and organized exam process.
- View upcoming and past exams with a clear overview for better planning and analysis.

### Authentication and Authorization (Your Security Shield):

- Implement secure user login and registration with a user-friendly interface.
- Control access to specific functionalities and data based on user roles (e.g., "ADMIN," "TEACHER"). Only authorized users can access sensitive areas, keeping your data safe!

## Project Structure (Your Navigation Map)

The project is meticulously organized using the following directory structure for easy maintenance and scalability:

- `src/main/java`: This is where the magic happens‚ÄîJava source code for Models, Controllers, Services, and Utility classes reside here.
- `src/main/resources`: Configuration files (like `application.properties`), and JSP templates for generating dynamic content live on the web pages.
- `src/test/java`: Unit and integration test classes ensure the quality and reliability of the application.
